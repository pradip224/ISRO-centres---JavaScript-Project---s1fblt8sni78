## Project objective

- You will be building an ISRO research centres  finder project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- In the end, we will have a frontend application in which you can type a city name, state name or an observatory name and get the names of centres of ISRO with their city name and state they are in .
- The API we are going to use in this project is [`https://isro.vercel.app/api/centres`](https://isro.vercel.app/api/centres)

## **Project Context**

- We all know about our Space agency of our country, but many few know about how many centres it has in  different cities with their names.
- The reason for the creation of this website is to make a platform where people can search their city name or state name and get the centres of ISRO in that city or state.
- One can also search for the ISRO observatory they know to get it located state and city.

**Tech stack Prerequisite:**  HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

## ****Project Steps****

- **Step-1**: Set up the project
    - Set up folder in which you have html , css and Javascript files that will contain code for your application.
    - It may also contains some images which will be required in the application
- **Step-2**: search functionality
    - when any user type anything in the `input field`   after selecting a `category`  then the selected centre's card will render which justify that category type and match with the `input`.
    - Suppose you want to search which centres of ISRO are there in the `state` Rajasthan  then you will click the button `state`  and type the name Rajasthan then it will show you all the centres in the states of Rajasthan .
    - Make sure the search field is not case-sensitive . The output for search input `Rajasthan` , `rajasthan`  should be same.
- **Step-3**: card rendering functionality
    - When no category is selected, all the centre's card will render by default.
    - When any category is selected and there is input in the search field, then only selected cards will render , like in the above given example only the cards which have their state Rajasthan will render .
